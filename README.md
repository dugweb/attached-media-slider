# attached-media-slider
Shortcode to get attached media for posts in Wordpress. Output a Bootstrap slider


Create a shortcode ([attached_pics]) that outputs a Bootstrap slider of the images attached to the post.

Whenever you upload images in Wordpress while looking at a post, then those images are deemed "attached" to that post. It's a little odd because there's no other functionality that really takes advantage of attached media, but it is quite convenient to be able to grab those images outside of the post body.
